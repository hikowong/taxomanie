PhyloCore library provides tools for manipulating tree collections and taxonomic information. It can be use either with NCBI [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/] or ITIS [http://www.itis.gov/ Itis database] taxonomic database  .

Main features of PhyloCore are:
 * Taxa manipulation:  
   * Getting all scientific names of taxa
   * Getting synonyms, homonyms and commons name from a scientific taxa name
   * Getting parents and children  
   * Getting rank
 * Trees manipulations:
   * Getting all taxa (Taxa objects) from newick tree format
   * Getting synonyms, commons names and homonyms from tree
   * Getting NetworkX arborescence (useful for graph manipulations)
 * Trees collections mapulations:
   * Support of phylip and nexus format
   * Getting bad formated tree names
   * Getting statistics (number for taxa, number of synonyms...)

= DjangoPhylocore vs PhyloCore =

DjangoPhylocore can not easily be used outside a django project. We thus create PhyloCore,  a wrapper against DjangoPhylocore, that provides the same functionnalities and can be used outside a django project. In short, if you developpe a web application upon django, use DjangoPhylocore, otherwise use PhyloCore.

= Dependencies =
PhyloCore relies on Django wich is written in Python. So, you need Python and Django.

PhyloCore is using a database for dealing with taxonomy. Please install SQLite3 or MySQL
and their python wrapper : [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python mysql-python] for MySQL or [http://initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/ pysqlite] for sqlite...

[http://networkx.lanl.gov/ NetworkX] for the graph manipulations. If you have easy_install you can install it via `easy_install networkx` as root.

[http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/ Pyparsing] for parsing newick collection (`easy_install pyparsing`)

You can check whether those dependencies have been successfully installed by typing those 
lines into the python interpreter:

{{{
>>> import sqlite3
>>> import django
>>> import networkx
>>> import pyparsing
}}}

= Installation =
First of all, download an install [http://www.djangoproject.com/download/ Django 1.0].

Then, checkout the svn repository:
{{{
svn checkout http://taxomanie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ taxomanie
}}}

Go to the PhyloCore folder and launch the `install` script:
{{{
cd taxomanie/phylocore-1.0
sudo ./install
}}}

This will create symbolic link into your $PYTHONPATH (/usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages)

In order to verify if the installation goes well, put this line into your sell:
{{{
( cd /tmp ; python -c "from phylocore import *" )
}}}
if nothing show up then you're good. Congratulation !
