= DjangoPhylocore vs PhyloCore =

DjangoPhylocore and PhyloCore are providing the same librairy. The difference relies on the django dependancies for DjangoPhylocore. That's mean that you can't use DjangoPhylocore outside of your django project. That's why we create PhyloCore wich is a wrapper against DjangoPhylocore that allow to use the librairy anywhere.

In short, if you developpe a web app apon django, use DjangoPhylocore. If not, use PhyloCore.


= Dependancies =
PhyloCore relies on Django wich is written in Python. So, you need Python and Django.

PhyloCore is using a database for dealing with taxonomy. Please install SQLite3 or MySQL.

You can install NetworkX for the graph manipulations (recomended).

= Installation =
First of all, download an install [http://www.djangoproject.com/download/ Django 1.0].

Then, checkout the svn repository:
{{{
svn checkout http://taxomanie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ taxomanie
}}}

Go to the PhyloCore folder and launch the `install` script:
{{{
cd taxomanie/phylocore
sudo ./install
}}}

This will create symbolic link into your $PYTHONPATH (/usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/site-package)
