= DjangoPhylocore vs PhyloCore =

DjangoPhylocore and PhyloCore are providing the same librairy. The difference relies on the django dependancies for DjangoPhylocore. That's mean that you can't use DjangoPhylocore outside of your django project. That's why we create PhyloCore wich is a wrapper against DjangoPhylocore that allow to use the librairy anywhere.

In short, if you developpe a web app apon django, use DjangoPhylocore. If not, use PhyloCore.
