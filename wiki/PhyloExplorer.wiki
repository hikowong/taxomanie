= About =

PhyloExplorer is a free, simple to use web service facilitating the management and enrichment of phylogenetic tree collections. 

Given an input collection of rooted trees, PhyloExplorer provides facilities for correcting erroneous or ambiguous taxon names,
for identifying related trees in TreeBASE, for obtaining statistics describing the collection, and a query language to extract
taxonomically relevant parts of the collection. PhyloExplorer is also available as a standalone version that includes both a
webserver identical to this one and package of Python libraries and database files that can be directly used by users with
computing skills.
