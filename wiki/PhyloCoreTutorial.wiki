#summary PhyloCore usage tutorial

= Introduction =

First of all, you'll have to import Django setting. So all of your scripts may begin like that :

{{{
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings'

from phylocore.models import *
}}}

Note that phylocore must be in your python path

= Working with Taxa =

To get a taxa from his name do:

{{{
>>> taxa = Taxa.objects.get( name = 'mus musculus' )
>>> taxa
<Taxa: mus musculus>
}}}

from this taxa, you will be able to get all the homonym, synonym and common names:

{{{
>>> taxa.homonyms.all()
[]
>>> taxa.synonyms.all()
[]
>>> taxa.commons.all()
[<CommonName: mouse (english)>, <CommonName: rat noir (french)>]
}}}

== Dealing with parents ==

Getting the first parent:

{{{
>>> taxa.parent
<Taxa: mus>
}}}

Parents can be chained:

{{{
>>> taxa.parent.parent
<Taxa: murinae>
}}}

Get all parents by order (closest to furthest). 'parents' attribute is a
simple liste containing Taxa

{{{
>>> taxa.parents
[<Taxa: mus>, <Taxa: murinae>, <Taxa: eukaryota>, <Taxa: root>]
>>> list( reversed( taxa.parents ) )
[<Taxa: root>, <Taxa: eukaryota>, <Taxa: murinae>, <Taxa: mus>]
}}}

'root' doesn't have parents

{{{
>>> root = Taxa.objects.get( name = 'root' )
>>> root.parents
[]
}}}

== About the source ==

Each taxa are 'traced'. Then we can know where he come from, what was its id and name in the source database.

{{{
# get info from sources
>>> taxa.get_id_in_source( 'itis' )
u'2334'
}}}

== Dealing with rank == 

You can know the rank of a taxa.

{{{
>>> taxa.rank
<Rank: species>
}}}

and you can get all taxa from a specify rank

{{{
>>> species = Rank.objects.get( name = 'species' )
>>> species.taxas.all()
[<Taxa: echinops <plant>>, <Taxa: echinops <mammal>>, <Taxa: mus musculus>]

>>> genus = Rank.objects.get( name = 'genus' )
>>> genus.taxas.all()
[<Taxa: rattus>, <Taxa: mus>]
}}}
